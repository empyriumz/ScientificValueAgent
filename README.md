The Scientific Value Agent (SVA) is a collection of tools for Gaussian Process (GP)-based Bayesian Optimization, particularly for use in epistemic experimentation (experiments in which you know nothing, have nothing to optimize and want to simply explore the experimental space as completely as you can).

<!-- > [!NOTE]

# üß± Install

Currently, the best way to install the SVA code is to simply clone the repository, then using `uv` to run campaigns (which installs the package to a local environment in editable mode). First, [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Then,

```bash
git clone git@github.com:matthewcarbone/ScientificValueAgent.git
cd ScientificValueAgent
uv run sva_run experiment=Sine2Phase policy=sva_importance_sampling
```

You can also use `uv run sva_run -h` to print the options to the command line (powered by [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/)).

In addition, there is a `justfile` which has a few useful commands. First, install [just](https://github.com/casey/just). Then, you can e.g. serve a Jupyter notebook using the SVA environment with `just serve-jupyter`.


# üöÄ Examples

See the [scripts](https://github.com/matthewcarbone/ScientificValueAgent/tree/master/scripts) directory for some examples of how to use SVA on some pre-defined [experiments](https://github.com/matthewcarbone/ScientificValueAgent/tree/master/sva/experiments). These use [Task Spooler](https://github.com/justanhduc/task-spooler) to launch many jobs in parallel, but you can simply remove the `ts` prefix to the command to launch them in your shell.

Once jobs have completed, [`read_data`](https://github.com/matthewcarbone/ScientificValueAgent/blob/41863beb95b9dc31bdf29e918b4ed3ec969dd1b5/sva/postprocessing.py#L42) can be used from `sva.postprocessing` to load all results, which can be further analyzed in e.g. a Jupyter Notebook.
